 14. Through the Website, the Company offers a marketplace for the buying and selling of Digital Assets. Digital Assets and the markets in which such Digital Assets are traded are listed at the sole discretion of the Company. The Company reserves the exclusive right to add and remove Digital Assets and markets from the Services at any time.
</div>
<br><br>
<div class="container-fluid">
15. While we strive to ensure that the marketplace is both fair and free, the Company cannot be held accountable for any form of market manipulation that may occur, whether it be within the marketplace, or in the worldwide marketplace for Digital Assets, including cryptocurrencies, as a whole
</div>
<br><br>
<div class="container-fluid">
16.The purchase and sale of Digital Assets, particularly digital and virtual currencies and cryptocurrencies, involves high levels of speculation and risk. Due to the constant and frequent fluctuations in value and exchange rates, the value of your Digital Assets may increase or decrease at any time. The Company does not and cannot control the value of any Digital Assets. By creating a Rapidpay Account or using the Website or the Services, you acknowledge and agree that the Company does not have any responsibility or liability to you or any other person whatsoever for any losses or gains incurred in connection with your use of the Website or the Services
</div>
